# Story 1.2: Configuraci√≥n Centralizada

Status: Completed

**Story:**
**As a** developer,
**I want** a centralized configuration system,
**so that** I can manage all API keys and environment variables securely and consistently across all services.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. An `.env.example` file is created at the project root.
2. The `.gitignore` file is updated to exclude `.env` files.
3. A shared package is created to load and provide environment variables.

**Tasks / Subtasks:**
- [X] Create `.env.example` file with all necessary variables.
- [X] Create `.gitignore` file and add `.env` to it.
- [X] Create `packages/config` directory.
- [X] Create `package.json` for `packages/config`.
- [X] Create `packages/config/src/index.ts` to load and export environment variables.
- [X] Install `dotenv` dependency.

**Dev Notes:**
- The `dotenv` library is used to load environment variables from a `.env` file.
- The configuration is exposed via a shared package `@packages/config`.

**Testing:**
- N/A for this story.
