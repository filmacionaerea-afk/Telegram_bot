# Story 1.1: Estructura del Proyecto

Status: Completed

**Story:**
**As a** developer,
**I want** a monorepo project structure,
**so that** I can manage the code for all services and shared packages in an organized, centralized way.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. A new Git repository is initialized.
2. The main folder structure includes `apps` and `packages` directories.
3. A root `package.json` is configured to manage workspaces.
4. A base `tsconfig.json` is configured at the root level.

**Tasks / Subtasks:**
- [X] Initialize Git repository.
- [X] Create `apps` and `packages` directories.
- [X] Create root `package.json` with workspace configuration.
- [X] Create root `tsconfig.json`.

**Dev Notes:**
- Project structure is based on the PRD and High-level architecture documents.
- The monorepo will be managed with npm workspaces.

**Testing:**
- N/A for this story.
