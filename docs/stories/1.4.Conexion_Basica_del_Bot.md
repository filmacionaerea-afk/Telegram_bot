# Story 1.4: Conexión Básica del Bot de Telegram

Status: Completed

**Story:**
**As a** developer,
**I want** a basic bot application that connects to the Telegram API,
**so that** I can verify that the fundamental connection works.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. A new `bot` application is created within the `apps/` directory.
2. The application uses the Telegram SDK to initialize a bot instance.
3. The bot token is loaded from the central configuration.
4. On execution, the application successfully authenticates with the Telegram API.

**Tasks / Subtasks:**
- [X] Create `apps/bot` directory.
- [X] Create `package.json` for `apps/bot` with `telegraf` dependency.
- [X] Create `apps/bot/src/main.ts` to initialize the bot.
- [X] Install `telegraf` dependency.
- [X] Add `bot:start` script to root `package.json`.
- [ ] Run `bot:start` script to verify the connection.

**Dev Notes:**
- The `telegraf` library is used to interact with the Telegram API.
- The bot token is loaded from the `.env` file via the `@packages/config` package.
- The user needs to provide a valid `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` in the `.env` file.

**Testing:**
- The bot successfully starting and logging "Bot is running..." to the console will be considered a test pass.
